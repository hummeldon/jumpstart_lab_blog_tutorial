# Jumpstart Lab Blog Tutorial

This is a repo to record my progress as I work through the [Jumpstart Lab's blog tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html). This is being done as part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails)

This project project is my first hands on experience with Ruby on Rails. Temporarily, I will be using the CSS stylesheet provided by the tutorial but as an extra challenge I plan to design my own CSS after finishing.
