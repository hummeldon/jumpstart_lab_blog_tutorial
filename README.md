# Jumpstart Lab Blog Tutorial

This is a repo to record my progress as I work through the [Jumpstart Lab's blog tutorial](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html). This is being done as part of [The Odin Project's curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/ruby-on-rails)

[Live version](https://shielded-escarpment-39617.herokuapp.com/)

Future goals for this project if I return to it.
1. Redesign the CSS to look nicer.
2. Complete the extra credit from I6 on the tutorial.
